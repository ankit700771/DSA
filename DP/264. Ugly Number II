/*
    Bruteforce approch is start from 1 and check that the number is ugly or not 
    for checking this condition are check the number is divisible by 2 or 3 or 5
    we do check this until that number become one if that number become 1 means that number is ugly number and increment the count

    similarly do this step until count == n and return this
